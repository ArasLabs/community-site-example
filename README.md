## History

Release notes/descriptions for the original project posted on the previous Aras Projects page.

Release | Notes
--------|--------
[v3.1](https://github.com/ArasLabs/community-site-example/releases/tag/v3.1) | Updated from version 3.1 to exclude references to non-standard identities
[v3.0](https://github.com/ArasLabs/community-site-example/releases/tag/v3.0) | Updated for Innovator v9.1 -- this build matches the solution running on MyInnovator.com and www.aras.com/communityProjects as of May 20, 2009
[v2.1](https://github.com/ArasLabs/community-site-example/releases/tag/v2.1) | Updated the Innovator package to include the Contact ItemType that was being referenced. This is an itemType in our Sales Automation solution package. I've included the necesary items, forms and lists here in this package so that it is stand-alone.
[v2.0](https://github.com/ArasLabs/community-site-example/releases/tag/v2.0) | Release for Innovator 8.2.0 and 9.0.1. Also many feature enhancements. The project is still only tested with Visual Studio 2003 NOTE: I renamed the Package for this release. before you import into an Innovator instance that has the com.aras.Communityprojects already loaded, you need to either rename or delete your existing package, to allow this package to load. Single zip file has the Innovator Solution package and the Visual Studio solution.
[v1.0](https://github.com/ArasLabs/community-site-example/releases/tag/v1.0) | Initial release - supports 8.1.1
