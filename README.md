# SilverLight Sample Web Client

Example web client using Microsoft Silverlight.

Silverlight uses an asynchronous model for XML-HTTP transactions which is an interesting programming challenge. The sample solution was developed as a Timesheet application, and then stripped down to demonstrate a useful pattern for making the asynchronous XML-HTTP requests to the Innovator Server.

Another interesting pattern in Silverlight development is Binding of XML data structures to UI elements. On one hand, this makes the development simpler, but only until you need something not covered by binding scenarios of course.

## History

Release notes/descriptions for the original project posted on the previous Aras Projects page.

[v1.0](https://github.com/ArasLabs/silverlight-client-sample/releases/tag/v1.0) | First release - works with VS2010, Silverlgiht 4, and Aras Innovator 9.2. This demonstration has a logo screen, and then runs a query of all User items, and populates a grid with the user data. We used this base code to build a complete TimeSheet data entry system.
